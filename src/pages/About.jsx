              I have always had a strong passion for programming and everything related to it, which is why I have decided to deepen my knowledge more and more. Despite being a game developer with a couple of years of experience with Unreal Engine, I now wanted to take an important new step for my profession, which is to study Godot Engine.

              I mainly use C++ and Blueprint, Python and Godot script as programming languages, however, following other branches of the sector, I have chosen to focus my study on front-end knowledge with HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript and React.js framework, while for the back-end Node.js with notions of MongoDB.

              Although I know that this path has no end, I am motivated to continue constantly every day.

              <br/>ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m working as Front-End Developer
              <br/>ðŸ“š I'm currently learning Python
              <br/>âš¡ In my free time, I read, write on my blog and personal novel, play video games, and have a deep passion for Japanese culture.
